## ✅ Assertive Auto-Checking Rules for Cursor

- Do **not** write phrases like **"make sure"**, **"please verify"**, or **"you should check"**.
- If something needs to be verified (e.g. existence of an endpoint, file, key, or response format), **write code that performs the check**.
- If the check fails, **raise a clear error or log a warning**, instead of asking the user to do it manually.
- Prefer actionable code over abstract suggestions. The goal is to automate, not to delegate.
- Only use imperative verbs when giving recommendations to the user, and only if the task **cannot** be done automatically.
- If you suggest a manual step, also offer the code to automate it whenever possible.

## 🔍 Examples

### ❌ Avoid this:
> Make sure your backend exposes `/generate-questions` and returns the correct format.

### ✅ Do this instead:
```python
import requests

try:
    response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/generate-questions")
    response.raise_for_status()
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    raise RuntimeError("Could not reach /generate-questions endpoint: " + str(e))
